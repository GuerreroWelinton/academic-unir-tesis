# Welcome to the ZGames UI Library

A modern, accessible, and reusable component library designed for iGaming experiences.

## What is ZGames UI?

ZGames UI is a design system and component library built with **Angular 21** that offers:

- **Production-ready components** optimized for performance
- **WCAG AA accessibility** built-in and validated
- **Design tokens** for consistent theming
- **Comprehensive documentation** with real-world examples
- **Composable architecture** following the Container–Presentational pattern

## Why ZGames UI?

This library was created to:

1. **Reduce technical debt** by centralizing UI components
2. **Ensure visual consistency** across products
3. **Accelerate development** with tested, reusable components
4. **Meet accessibility requirements** for iGaming regulations (MGA, UKGC)
5. **Enable theming** to support multiple brands

## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Container–Presentational Pattern

All components in this library are **presentational (dumb) components**:

- ✅ Receive data via **signal input** (`input`)
- ✅ Emit user actions via **signal output** (`output`)
- ❌ Do not inject services or contain business logic
- ❌ Do not make API calls or side-effects

**Smart containers** live in your application, not in the library.

### Design Tokens

Each component uses **custom CSS properties** (design tokens) for styles:

```css
/* ❌ Don't do this */
background: #9c27b0;

/* ✅ Do this */
background: var(--zg-color-primary);
```

This enables:

- Dynamic theming
- Client customization
- Consistent visual language

### Atomic Design

We adopt the **Atomic Design** approach to structure our library and guide component evolution. This provides a common language for designers and developers and improves reusability:

- **Atoms**: The smallest, independent elements (e.g., `Button`, `Badge`, `Input`). The foundation of the system.
- **Molecules**: Combinations of atoms forming functional units (e.g., a `Card` with `Badge` and `Button`).
- **Organisms**: More complex, self-contained compositions (e.g., `Modal`, full UI sections).

How we apply it:

- Components are organized in folders: `atoms/`, `molecules/`, `organisms/`.
- Consistent conventions (`variant`, `size`, `disabled`) for easy consumption.
- Design tokens are defined at the base and consumed by atoms, propagating consistency upward.
- This structure facilitates testing, documentation, and maintenance as the library grows.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install @zgames/ui
```

### Importing Components

All components are **standalone** and can be imported directly:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { ZgButtonComponent } from '@zgames/ui';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [ZgButtonComponent],
  template: ` <zg-button variant="primary" (clicked)="handleClick()"> Click me </zg-button> `,
})
export class MyComponent {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }
}
```

## ♿ Accessibility

Each component is validated against **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standards.

By default, the **a11y** Storybook addon is configured to run checks for **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**.

You will find accessibility information in the **Accessibility** tab of each component story, including:

- Issues that require fixing
- Passed tests that meet WCAG
- Manual checks to verify
